2) splunk

login validation done by us is simple
	if condition			username and password		
		success
	else
		failure

	select * from user where username=? and password=?

	if this query returns 0 records
		login is failure
	else
		you got 1 object of user then it is success

	keep this user object in localStorage (angular)
	
every page you visit, first we check if localStorage has an item "user" 
	if it is null
		you have not logged in
	else
		you have logged in

	while logging out,	destroy the localStorage

Spring boot security

Basic functionality should be completed 

Splunk
-------
	need?
		Every day, lot of log entries are created.
		who is giving the information?	machine
		machine data				(big data)
			because, every transaction or error or any activity , causes lot of log messages
		this over a period of time becomes huge information that can be used to diagnose or analyze

	the log information is not very useful because of its nature or format
	if such log information is available as pie chart or Bar chart or graph, trend, then how userful it will be?

	Splunk was introduced

can we create alerts?	like some log entries generated in aws is unnoticed. Can we configure aws clusters containers to integrate it with splunk so that it can forward the critical log entries
